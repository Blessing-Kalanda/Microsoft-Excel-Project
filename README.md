### Preparing For Analysis

A glance at my data shows me the information available and this influences the variety of questions possible.

After studying the dataset closely, the following questions are drafted:

1. Which retailer generated the highest reevnue?
2. Which region or location had the highest sales?
3. Wich month of the year is the company's peak sales period?
4. What is the most preferred sales method?
5. Which product are the top sellers?
6. Which day of the week generated the highest revenue?

This questions give me a sense of direction and help me understand the data more and possibly find more insights.

### Data Cleaning

Before starting the analysis, the data must be clean and analysis ready. The things i did to achieve this are
- converting the document from a csv file to an xlxs document,
- checking for spelling errors in column heads
- increasing the column width
- checking for outliers
- handling blank and duplicate values
- dropping columns that are not so important to my analytics

### Pivot Tabls and Pivot Charts

Now the data is ready for exloratory data analysis.

To ensure that the earlier highlighted questions are answered with ease, i made use of pivot tables to further summarize my dataset.

Here is a glance at some of the pivot tables i created.

Each question will now be answered by the use of the pivot tabel created and subsequently visualized by the use of Pivot Charts.

1. Which retailer generated the highest revenue?
